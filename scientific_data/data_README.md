# RA-Map Scientific Data Scripts

This repository contains markdown scripts relating to the RA-Map project [scientific data paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01264-y)

EDA: In the EDA directory, you'll find markdown documents summarizing our outlier detection and removal procedures for transcriptomic data at baseline ("0m_outliers.md") and 6-months ("6m_outliers.md"). You'll also find EDA pipelines for all platforms, including RDS data objects for autoantibody, metabolomics (serum and urine), miRNA, and proteomics. RDS data objects for mRNA are located in figshare (https://figshare.com/projects/RA-Map_a_multi-omic_immune_cell_landscape_in_early_RA/76398)

The "Imputing_clinical.md" file describes our procedure for imputing gender and height.

The "DEA.md" file summarizes our differential expression analyses for transcriptomic data, testing for associations with disease and response.
