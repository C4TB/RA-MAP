# RA-Map Scripts

This repository contains markdown scripts for the RA-Map project. 

In the EDA directory, you'll find markdown documents summarizing our outlier detection and removal procedures for transcriptomic data at baseline ("0m_outliers.md") and 6-months ("6m_outliers.md"). You'll also find EDA pipelines for all platforms, including autoantibody, metabolomics (serum and urine), miRNA, mRNA, and proteomics.

The "Imputing_clinical.md" file describes our procedure for imputing gender and height.

The "DEA.md" file summarizes our differential expression analyses for transcriptomic data, testing for associations with disease and response.
